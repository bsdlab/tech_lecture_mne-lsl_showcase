# MNE LSL closed-loop usecase

A sample usecase following and extending the example from [mne-lsl](https://mne.tools/mne-lsl/stable/generated/tutorials/40_epochs.html#sphx-glr-generated-tutorials-40-epochs-py) with a real time plotting component.

## Install and run

The common routine: clone, install requirements and run main.
Here is e.g., with using `uv` to manage the virtual environment:

```bash
git https://github.com/bsdlab/tech_lecture_mne-lsl_showcase
cd tech_lecture_mne-lsl_showcase
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
uv run main.py
```
